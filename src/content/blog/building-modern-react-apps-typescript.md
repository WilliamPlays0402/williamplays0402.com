# Creating a new Website with Astro and Tailwind CSS

In this blog post, I will share my experience of building my new website using Astro and Tailwind CSS. The goal was to create a fast, modern, and responsive site that showcases my projects and skills effectively.

## Why Astro?
Astro is a modern static site generator that allows you to build fast websites with minimal JavaScript. It supports multiple front-end frameworks, making it flexible for developers. I chose Astro for its performance benefits and ease of use, especially when combined with Tailwind CSS to create a beautiful and responsive design without sacrificing speed.

## Setting Up the Project

To get started, I created a new Astro project using the following command:

```bash
npm create astro@latest
```

This command initializes a new Astro project with the latest version. I chose the minimal template to keep things simple and focused on my needs.

```bash
npx astro add tailwind react
```

This command adds Tailwind CSS and React support to the Astro project, allowing me to use Tailwind's utility-first CSS framework for styling and React components for interactivity.

## Project Structure
The project structure is straightforward, with the main files located in the `src` directory. Here's a brief overview:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── layouts/
│   ├── pages/
│   └── styles/
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory, which are used to create routes based on their file names. The `src/components/` directory is where I store reusable components, and `src/styles/` contains my Tailwind CSS configuration.

## Styling with Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development. I configured Tailwind in my Astro project by creating a `tailwind.config.js` file and importing the styles in my main CSS file.

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  content: ['./src/**/*.{astro,html,js,jsx,ts,tsx}'],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

I then imported Tailwind's base, components, and utilities styles in my main CSS file:

```css
@import 'tailwindcss';
```
This setup allows me to use Tailwind's utility classes throughout my components, making it easy to create responsive designs.

## Building Components

I created several reusable components to keep my code organized and maintainable. For example, I built a `Button` component that can be used throughout the site:

I won't go into the full code here (feel free to check the source code on GitHub), but here's a brief overview of the `Button` component:

```tsx
import React from 'react';

type ButtonProps = {
  href: string;
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'outline';
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
  children: React.ReactNode;
};

const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ href, variant = 'primary', size = 'md', children }) => {
  const baseStyles = 'inline-flex items-center justify-center font-medium rounded-md focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2';
  const variantStyles = {
    primary: 'bg-blue-600 text-white hover:bg-blue-700 focus:ring-blue-500',
    secondary: 'bg-gray-100 text-gray-800 hover:bg-gray-200 focus:ring-gray-500',
    outline: 'border border-gray-300 text-gray-800 hover:bg-gray-100 focus:ring-gray-500',
  };
  const sizeStyles = {
    sm: 'px-3 py-1.5 text-sm',
    md: 'px-4 py-2 text-base',
    lg: 'px-5 py-2.5 text-lg',
  };

  return (
    <a href={href} className={`${baseStyles} ${variantStyles[variant]} ${sizeStyles[size]}`}>
      {children}
    </a>
  );
};

export default Button;
```

This component allows me to create buttons with different styles and sizes, making it easy to maintain a consistent look across the site.

## Responsive Design

To ensure my website is responsive, I utilized Tailwind's responsive utility classes. For example, I used classes like `md:text-lg` to adjust text sizes based on the screen width. This approach allows the site to look great on both desktop and mobile devices without writing custom media queries.

## Deployment

Once the site was ready, I deployed it to my Raspberry Pi that is running a web server. Astro generates static files that can be served by any web server, making deployment straightforward.
In this case, I am using Nginx to serve the static files generated by Astro. The deployment process involves building the site and copying the output to the server's web root directory.

```bash
npm run build
scp -r dist/* user@your-raspberry-pi-ip:/var/www/html
```

This command builds the site and copies the generated files to the web server directory on my Raspberry Pi.

## Conclusion

Building my new website with Astro and Tailwind CSS has been a rewarding experience. The combination of Astro's performance and Tailwind's utility-first approach allowed me to create a fast, modern, and responsive site that showcases my projects effectively.

I hope this post provides some insights into how I built my website. If you're interested in web development, I highly recommend trying out Astro and Tailwind CSS for your next project. They make building modern websites a breeze!

And as always, happy coding!
